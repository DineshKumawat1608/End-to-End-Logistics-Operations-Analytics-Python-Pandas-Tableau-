## 📊 Data Analysis (EDA & Advanced Analysis)

### Objective

Understand logistics activity and performance across **trips, customers, vehicles, drivers, and time**.

### Analysis Performed

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Table-level and column-level data exploration
- Dimension analysis (customers, vehicles, drivers, locations)
- Date-based analysis (trip and booking timelines)
- Measure analysis (trip count, distance, duration, activity levels)

#### Trend Analysis
- Month-wise and date-wise trip trends
- Cumulative trends to track operational growth

#### Performance Analysis
- Top and bottom customers based on activity
- Vehicle and driver usage analysis

#### Advanced Analysis
- Part-to-whole analysis by customer, location, and vehicle type
- Simple segmentation of customers and trips based on usage

#### Reporting
- Prepare clean datasets and summary tables for dashboards
